Aerys is a non-blocking HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 application, WebSocket and static file server written in PHP based on the [`amp`](https://github.com/amphp/amp) concurrency framework.

Aerys has currently a few 0.x tags. APIs are still subject to very small changes and you may run into rogue ~~bugs~~ features. We love PRs, though :-)

## Running a Server

```bash
php bin/aerys -c demo.php
```

Simply execute the `aerys` binary (with PHP 7) to start a server listening on `http://localhost/` using
the default configuration file (packaged with the repository).

Add a `-d` switch to see some debug output like the routes called etc.:

```bash
php bin/aerys -d -c demo.php
```

## Config File

Use the `-c, --config` switches to define the config file:

```bash
php bin/aerys -c /path/to/my/config.php
```

Use the `-h, --help` switches for more instructions.

## Static File Serving

To start a static file server simply pass a root handler as part of your config file.

```php
(new Aerys\Host)
    ->expose("*", 1337)
    ->use(Aerys\root(__DIR__ . "/public"));
```
